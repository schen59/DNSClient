How to build the project?

    Use 'mvn clean install' to build the project, the .jar file will be found in the target
    directory. This project also use external dependency 'apache.common.lang3' so I bundled the
    dependency in the *jar-with-dependency.jar file.

How to run it?

    Use 'java -cp lab2-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar core.DNSClient server-name
    query-name query-type' to run it. Currently support query type of 'A', 'MX', 'NS', 'SOA',
    and support response RRType of 'A', 'CNAME', 'MX', 'NS', 'SOA', 'AAAA'.

Note:

    The default udp socket timeout was set to 1 second, it can be changed in common.Constants.
    The dafault value for udp packet buffer size was set to be 1024 bytes,
    it can be changed in common.Constants.
